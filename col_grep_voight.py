### col_grep.py
### Caleb Matthew Radens
### 2015_2_14

###    This script copies lines from a file that are grep-match-groupable at a column of interest,
###        and writes to file each matched group of lines to their own file, named after the group.
###
###    Arguments:
###        in_FILE
###            non-zipped!
###        delim: how is the input file delimited? 
###            for comma, write: ,
###            for tab, write: tab
###            if it's delimted some other way, please let me know and I'll test/update the script
###        skip: How many lines to skip?
###            integer >= 0
###        Column_index: which column to group by
###            integer (0 is first column)
###        out_DIR: where should files by written to?
###            *Extant* and *empty* directory
###        folderize: Should each file be put into it's own sub-directory?
###            'y_fold' or 'n_fold'
###
###    Assumptions:
###        The skipped lines aren't formatted like the rest of the file, and/or the col of interest
###            in the skipped lines are not grep-identical to any row below the skipped lines in
###            the col of interest.
###        ***The col of interest doesn't have something unix/bash-interpretable in it***
###        You're using a LSF job schedule and the following bash command looks familiar:
###            > bsub -e error.err -o out.out python my_fav_script.py
###        The out_DIR exists and is EMPTY 
###
###    Usage:
###        python grep_col.py in_file.txt delim skip Column_# out_DIR folderize
###
###    Note:
###        I suggest submitting this script as a job and to include the -e err and -o out files.
